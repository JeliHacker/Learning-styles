    <td>Dweck emphasizes the importance of mindset in learning. She draws from studies of children in which those with 
     "growth" mindsets believe that their intelligence and achievement is a result of their effort and those with "fixed"
     mindsets believe that their intelligence is static and unchangable and their achievement a result of their natural ability
     . Dweck points out that growth mindsets are conducive to increased learning, curiosity, and amount of joy experienced
     while fixed mindsets are detrimental to all of these aspects.</td>
     <td>Muller, of the successful education channel on YouTube "Veritasium," explains his reasoning for asking people
     questions that may make them look foolish.</td>

     <td>Peter Drucker, who wrote the classic management book "Managing Oneself", argues that people fall into one of two
     categories in how they best learn. People, he claims, are either readers or listeners, and are <q>rarely both</q>. </td>
